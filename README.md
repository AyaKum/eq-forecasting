This repository contains two files related to the optimization of regression and classification models for earthquake prediction. Various machine learning models, including KNN, Random Forest, and XGBoost, were used to analyze earthquake-related data.
Classification Model Optimization: Machine learning models were optimized for classifying earthquake occurrences.
Regression Model Optimization: Regression models were fine-tuned to forecast earthquake magnitudes. The earthquake data were accessed through the USGS API (United States Geological Survey), providing real-time and historical seismic event records.
